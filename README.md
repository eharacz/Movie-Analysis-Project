Project Goals:

Explore 2018 movie data by genre and market (foreign vs. domestic) to determine what genre movie to focus production on.


Questions:


Can we look at 2018 to determine which genres in what markets will perform best?

What genres produce the most revenue?

How does foreign vs domestic market affect revenue?

Can we choose what genre we should produce based on the revenues of 2018 films?

Findings:


Action genre has the largest market

Family films perform best by movie (Sample size was small however) followed by Action and Animation respectively.

Drama had the most movies produced followed by Documentary then Comedy.

There is a very strong correlation between performance Domestically vs. Foreign.Testing a movie domestically would give a very good sense if the movie would be successful abroad. 

Recommendation:


Action, Animation and Family would be the top three genres we recommend.

Family produces a very high average revenue per movie and the market is not saturated with a large count of films.

Action has by far the largest market and revenue per movie is high.

Animation, like Family, has a lower count of movies and a very solid revenue per movie.

Testing a movie domestically would give a very good sense if the movie would be successful abroad.
